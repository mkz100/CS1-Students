# Project 3 - Data Structure and Algorithms (1)

## Requirements
### Create a `Person` class
* Attributes:
  * name
  * age
    
* Constructor:
  * take in parameters to initialize the name and age

* Implement Methods:
  * getter methods for name and age
  * toString method to return the output in this format: {name: real_name, age: real_age}

* Implement the `Comparable` interface which compares the age. 

### Implement one of the sorting algorithm to sort the array of person(s)
* Choose and implement any sorting algorithm you like to sort the array of person(s) in order.
* Print the person instances in the sorted order. (toString method should be used to format the output)

### Create a Test program 
* Create 5 instances using the Person constructor by giving the names and ages of your choice
* Put them in an array
* Use your sort algorithm to sort the array
* Print the array in sorted order

### Examples:
* Watch class videos: 8-3 to 8-7
* There are examples in the videos.

## How to do it:
* This is a group project.
* Please form or join a group of <5 members.
* Please work together as a group but each member has to contribute.
* All code has to be compilable and tested.
* Write your names on the test program and turn in your code with test data and output data.

## How to submit it:
* Create a `your_group_name/README.md` file for your group in [projects/project3](.). 
  * Note: `your_group_name` is your group name which should be different from others.
  * Write your group member's names and contributions in the `README.md` file and add any notes there if you have.
  * Then click the `Commit new file` button at the bottom.
  * Example: https://github.com/mkz100/CS1-Students/blob/master/projects/project2/my_group_name_sample/README.md
  * Follow steps here https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser
* Upload the source code files to the `your_group_name` folder
  * navigate to the `your_group_name` folder: click the `Add file` button -> `Upload files`
